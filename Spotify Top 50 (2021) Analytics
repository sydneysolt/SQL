/*The CSV file used in this exercise was found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021?select=spotify_top50_2021.csv

To create the table in SQLite Studio, I used the following SQL code:*/

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (

track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,

loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,

liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

/*Next, I imported the CSV file linked above to populate the newly created Spotifydata table with data.

My queries are below.*/

1. Of 2021's Top 50, what were the three most popular songs?*/

SELECT artist_name
, track_name
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 3


/*2. Which arist had the most songs in 2021's Top 50? How many songs in the Top 50 did they have, and what was their most popular song?*/

SELECT COUNT(artist_name) AS number_of_top50_songs
, artist_name
, (SELECT track_name FROM Spotifydata ORDER BY popularity DESC) AS most_popular_track
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(artist_name) DESC
LIMIT 1


/*3. Determine what songs would be best to play at a night club.*/

SELECT artist_name
, track_name
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE ROUND(tempo) >= 110
ORDER BY popularity, danceability, energy
LIMIT 15
